Automatically accept pending payments in PayPal using Tampermonkey


This tampermonkey script will automatically accept all pending payments in your paypal account under the activities tab.

This was made because PayPal made so you have to MANUALLY accept every payment you receive that is not from your default currency, 
so it could take you hours to accept every payment you receive in a month.

How to use:

1. Download the tampermonkey extension (https://www.tampermonkey.net/)
2. Download the .txt file under Releases Tab
3. Go to your tampermonkey settings -> utility -> import from file -> select the downloaded file
4. Enable tampermonkey
5. Go to www.paypal.com/myaccount/activities;


** This is completely safe as it only replicates user behavior **
