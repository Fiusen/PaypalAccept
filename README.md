Auto Accept pendent payments in paypal using TamperMonkey


This tampermonkey script will automatically accept all pendent payments in your paypal account under the "www.paypal.com/myaccount/activities" url.
This was made as paypal for some stupid reason made so you have to MANUALLY accept every payment you receive that is not from your default currency (whos idea was that?),
so it could take you hours to accept every payment you receive in a month.

How to use:

1. Download the tampermonkey extension (https://www.tampermonkey.net/)
2. Download the .txt file under Releases Tab
3. Go to your tampermonkey settings -> utility -> import from file -> select the downloaded file
4. Enable tampermonkey
5. Go to www.paypal.com/myaccount/activities;


** This is completely safe as it only replicates user behavior **
